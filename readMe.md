## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Git.
- You have installed Python (preferably Python 3.7 or later).
- You have installed `pip` (Python package installer).

### Installing Git

**Windows:**

Download the installer from Git for Windows.

Run the installer and follow the instructions.

**macOS:**

Open Terminal and run:

brew install git

**Linux:**

Open Terminal and run:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git

### Installing Python and Pip

**Windows and macOS:**

Download the installer from Python's official website.

Run the installer and ensure you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

**Linux:**

Open Terminal and run:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages:

Open Terminal.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-learning-chat.git

or use the ssh directory:

git@github.com:your-username/the-learning-chat.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd the-learning-chat

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Note:** Ensure you have installed all necessary dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. These dependencies are crucial for the proper functioning of the project.

Examples of what you should install:

pip install openai

pip install --upgrade openai

pip install python

## Setting Up Environment Variables

This project requires an OpenAI API key to function. You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key.

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

touch .env

Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## Running the Project

After setting up the environment variables, you can run the project:

Open Terminal.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd the-learning-chat

Now run the program:

python run.py

## Usage

Running the main script:

python the_learning_chat/main.py

This script prompts you to enter a prompt and a model type if desired.

Example input:

Enter the prompt (default: Hello World!): Riddle of the day!

Enter the model (default: gpt-3.5-turbo): gpt-4-turbo

Example output:

Sure, I'd love to give you a riddle! Here's one for you: I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?

## Testing

To run tests, use the following commands:

python -m unittest discover tests

This command will discover and run all tests in the `tests` directory.

## Other Commands

pip run format: Format code using a formatter.

pip run typing: Check typing using mypy.

pip run docs: Generate documentation.

pip run build: Build the package for distribution.

pip run publish: Publish to PyPI.
